#Tic-Tac-Toe game

It's a tic-tac-toe game implemented on java
Implemented different field sizes and computer opponent behaviour. 

###Computer opponent modes:
* Easy - Computer makes random move to any empty cell
* Medium - Computer finds combination which could finish game and blocks this, or finishes it. 
* Hard - Computer analysed every available move for it and selects the move which highest probability of win and lowest probability of lose (MiniMax algorythm) - working good for classic field size, in other cases too much moves for analyse.
* Self-learning algorithm - Computer using own experience to win the game.

You also can check the efficiency of every mode and made all players computers.
